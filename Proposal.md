# IT266UnrealProject
Location for files associated with the first class project, making a game in Unreal.

I am going to make a 2D side-scrolling platformer. The main goal is to reach the end of the level while collecting as many points as possible.
I hope to include some basic enemies that will reward points when they are destroyed by the player.
There will also be another way to earn points by collecting different objects which reward the player with points, such as a coin.
